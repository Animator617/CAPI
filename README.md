# CAPI Framework
This will be a Framework for C++ to create REST API's it will support HTTP/1.1 HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
also it is aimed to have a syntac like FastAPI and should include an ORM system at least thats the plan of it 
also i had the idea to do it all in header files in hope thet would make the use of it easier for the end user

# Benchmarks:
in the latest benchmarks i run i achived tuned the router to a speed that matched with Nginx with im quite proud about tbh ^^
